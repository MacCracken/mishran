## [0.1.0] - unreleased

### Added

- Repo scaffolded: pure-Cyrius software audio mixer + routing server that
  fans many per-app PCM streams into one mixed/resampled writer to vani —
  buildable skeleton with `MshStream` ring buffers (S16), a real
  sum-and-clamp `msh_mix` fan-in, and the single-writer `MshRouter`
  (`error.cyr` / `stream.cyr` / `mix.cyr` / `route.cyr`; `smoke.cyr` links
  the full include chain green). Real resampling, per-stream gain, the F32
  path, and the `vani` sink are deferred to later cycles.
